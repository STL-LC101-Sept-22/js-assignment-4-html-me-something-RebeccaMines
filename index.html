            During the summer of 2022, I went on an adventure to The Renaissance
            Festival with some of my best friends. There were a lot of cool
            things for us to see! Rows of venders to shop from, large booths
            where ceremonies and jousting would take place, and everybody was
            dressed up in character! I even found a man with a very large dragon
            puppet that let me take a photo with him. How cool!

            We decided to try some tea from one of the popular food vendors. The
            line was super long, but it was worth the wait! The tea was so sweet
            and had a unique, flowery taste unlike anything I've ever tried
            before!

            Lastly, a photagrapher came along who loved our costumes, so he
            asked us if he could take our pictures. We said yes of course! We
            connected on social media &amp; he shared the photos with us a few
            weeks later. They really turned out great!
