      During the summer of 2022, I went on an adventure to The Renaissance
      Festival with some of my best friends. It was one of the most memerable
      adventures I've ever had &amp; I'd love to share some of my favorite
      memories with you!

      There were a lot of cool things for us to see! Rows of venders to shop
      from, large booths where ceremonies &amp; jousting would take place, &amp;
      everybody was dressed up in character! I even found a man with a very
      large dragon puppet that let me take a photo with him. How cool!

      We decided to try some tea from one of the popular food vendors. The line
      was super long, but it was worth the wait! The tea was so sweet &amp; had
      a unique, flowery taste unlike anything I've ever tried before!

      Just around the corner from the tea vendor was a spit with a huge ham on
      it, &amp; a fairy woman performing on a tall metal ring! We took the
      opportunity to rest on the benches, drink our tea &amp; watch the
      performance together by the fire.

      Lastly, a photagrapher came along who loved our costumes, so he asked us
      if he could take our pictures. We said yes of course! We connected on
      social media &amp; he shared the photos with us a few weeks later. They
      really turned out great!
